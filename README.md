SECexplorer
===========

SECexplorer is a web interface to the *R* package SECprofiler.

This project consists of two parts:

- The `client/` folder contains a javascript-based frontend making use of the framework
  [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/).

- A `server/` folder holds Python code for the backend server based on
  [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).  Further the backend uses `rpy2` to execute the functions from the
  `SECprofiler` R package.


How is the web server setup ?
-----------------------------

The only role of apache in this setting is to run the backend, the frontend
on port 443 is served by client/start_nodejs_for_frontend script.

When we open a web browser and request `http://sec-explorer.ethz.ch` we
communicate with a `nodejs` web server listening on port 443. This server is
configured and setup in the `client` folder.

Currently this web server only serves the `index.html` file plus the referenced
static java script and css files. 

The clients  javascript code requests the functions from the `R` pacakge
`SECprofiler` by accessing the backend server who offers a web service on the
URL `http://127.0.0.1:8020/app`. 

This backend Python server is implemented with `flask`. Apache listens on port
8020 and forwards requests to the `app.wsgi` script using the apache module
`mod_wsgi`.



How to setup and install the web server
----------------------------------------

**First read the `client/README.md` file for installing `nodejs` and the
requires javascript packages.**

**Furter check the installation instructions in the `SECprofiler` package. This
`R` package must be accesssible by `rpy2` within the Python backend.**

We implemented a unit file `sec_explorer.server` for `systemd` for proper
startup and shutdown of this processes. More details below.


*The following instructions where developed and tested on `Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS`.
They should work for new versions as well, but might break on older versions as
`systemd` was not default system manager before `Ubuntu 15.04`.*

To install the `sec_explorer.service` file and to configure apache  we assume
that your current working directory is the one holding this `README.md` file.
Then run:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/sec_explorer.service /lib/systemd/system
$ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/for_apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/sec-explorer.conf
$ sudo systemctl enable sec_explorer.service
```



Development on the web server setup
==================================

In case you edit the `sec_explorer.service` file you first have to reload it:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```


How to start / stop the web server
=========================

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start sec_explorer.service
```

If this fails or in case you need more information about the status of the involved processes run

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status sec_explorer.service apache2.service
```

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop sec_explorer.service
```
